ItsCalledAppleWatch
===================

 Watch or  Pay look silly. This extension turns them into Apple Watch or Apple Pay.

Removes the unicode/ascii Apple symbol when used next to 'watch' or 'pay'. 

I have it set to just reddit.com for now. 

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store

Soon.

### Manually. 

Got to `chrome://extensions` in the omnibar and simply drag `ItsCalledAppleWatch.crx` into the window.
