ItsCalledAppleWatch
===================

Using  Watch and  Pay look silly.... this extension turns them into 'Apple Watch' or 'Apple Pay',respectively.

Removes the unicode/ascii Apple symbol when used next to 'watch' or 'pay'. 

Right now it only changes the text on reddit.com, I can always add more. 

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store

Soon.

### Manually. 

Enter `chrome://extensions` in the omnibar and simply drag `ItsCalledAppleWatch.crx` into the window. Allow it to install.
